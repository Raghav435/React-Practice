# Difference between props and state:

## PROPS:
The Data is passed from one component to another.
It is Immutable (cannot be modified).
Props can be used with state and functional components.
Props are read-only	

## STATE:
The Data is passed within the component only.
It is Mutable ( can be modified).
State can be used only with the state components/class component.
State is both read and write.

## Map:
map() applies the function it receives as an argument to each element in a sequence and returns the resulting sequence. We create a list of integers and using map() and Python’s str() function, we cast each integer into a string. The output is a list of strings.

## Filter:
filter() takes a function called a predicate that returns “True” if an element passes the condition stated in the predicate, and “False” otherwise. The filter() function’s output consists of the elements of the original sequence that pass the predicate.

## Reduce:
reduce() applies the function to the elements of the sequence, from left to right, starting with the first two elements in the sequence. We combine the result of applying the function to the sequence’s first two elements with the third element and pass them to another call of the same function. This process repeats until we reach the end of the iterable and the iterable reduces to a single value.
